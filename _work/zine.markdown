intro: Revamping a publicationâ€”content structure, design and development.
info: |-
  The &rsquo;Zine is an online magazine started and run by Meghna Gulati, that seeks to provide a platform for the stories and thoughts of the Indian youth. I was responsible with designing and developing the initial version of the site, back in 2013. Two years after the initial launch, I was contacted again for a redesign.

  My job was mainly to do 3 things: revamping the whole content structure of the magazine, crafting a new visual aesthetic, and coding the whole site with a CMS-backed infrastructure. So yeah, I was pretty much turning the whole magazine over on its head.
